We will make a web page that uses:

 - Materialize css
 - OpenWeather API
 - Yelp API
 - JQUERY
 
 Upon loading (if a request has been made in the last five days) populate 5 day forcast with dates/days
 events for each day will be shown for the corresponding days as well. 
 Users will make a request, and the results will populate the current and next four day weather forcast 
 and corresponding events for that day (limit 3).
